        <li>An Internet aggregator is a site that combines various thematic platforms in order to increase their sales level and ensure the convenience of users' choice of dishes and drinks. A distinctive feature of the site is a unified design, user-friendly interface. Here companies are not advertised, do not compete with each other in a colorful presentation. They are offered as part of a catalog of establishments that operate in your city.</li>
        <li>The operating principle of an internet aggregator is quite simple. On the Internet resource, the user is provided with a wide range of cafes and restaurants for the delivery of ready-made food. Among all the establishments, a person chooses an establishment that is interesting to him, forms an order. The user does not pay a percentage or a flat rate for working with the resource. The prices presented here are similar to the restaurant's menu published on the official website. Meanwhile, a restaurant, cafe, pizzeria or other establishment must give 15-20% of the total order value to the aggregator. In the West, this figure does not even reach 10%. Experts suggest that a high percentage in Russia is associated with a relatively young system of Internet aggregators. As soon as the competition is higher, the percentage will decrease.</li>
